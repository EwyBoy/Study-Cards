# Study-Cards

This is a demo I made for a school project in interaction design class INFO-262.  
The demo is a prototype of a study card application. The application has the question on the front and the answer on the back. The answer can be viewed holding down the mouse or touch on your device. The navigate and hint buttons don't work quite yet but are work in progress.
